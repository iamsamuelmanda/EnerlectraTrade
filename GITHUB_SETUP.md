# GitHub Integration Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `enerlectra-energy-trading`
4. Description: `African energy trading platform with USSD, AI, and blockchain integration`
5. Set to **Public** (recommended for open source energy access)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Project to GitHub

In your terminal/command line:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Enerlectra energy trading platform with CI/CD"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enerlectra-energy-trading.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add these secrets:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = your_anthropic_api_key_here
REPLIT_TOKEN = your_replit_deployment_token (optional)
```

## Step 4: Verify CI/CD Pipeline

1. Make a small change to any file (e.g., add a comment to README.md)
2. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```
3. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub to see the workflow running
4. Check that all tests pass and deployment succeeds

## Step 5: Set Up Branch Protection

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

## Step 6: Create Development Workflow

```bash
# Create development branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# For new features, create feature branches
git checkout -b feature/cluster-architecture
# Make changes, commit, push
git push -u origin feature/cluster-architecture
# Create pull request on GitHub to merge into develop
```

## Expected GitHub Features After Setup:

### Automated Workflows
- ✅ **Push to main** → Automatic production deployment
- ✅ **Push to develop** → Automatic staging deployment  
- ✅ **Pull requests** → Automatic testing and validation
- ✅ **Security scanning** → Weekly dependency audits
- ✅ **Performance testing** → API response time monitoring

### Repository Management
- ✅ **Issue tracking** with bug report and feature request templates
- ✅ **Pull request reviews** with structured templates
- ✅ **Branch protection** preventing direct pushes to main
- ✅ **Automated merging** after successful tests
- ✅ **Release management** with semantic versioning

### Integration Benefits
- 🌍 **Global collaboration** on African energy access
- 📊 **Transparency** in energy trading platform development
- 🔄 **Version control** for all platform changes
- 🤝 **Community contributions** from developers worldwide
- 📈 **Analytics** on development velocity and quality

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup:

1. **Test the CI/CD** by making a small change and pushing
2. **Invite collaborators** to contribute to African energy access
3. **Create first release** with current stable version
4. **Set up project board** for issue tracking and planning
5. **Configure webhooks** for deployment notifications

## Troubleshooting:

### If CI/CD fails:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Verify all secrets are configured correctly
- Ensure API endpoints are responding during tests

### If deployment fails:
- Confirm ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in GitHub secrets
- Check that all dependencies are properly listed
- Verify build process completes successfully

### If tests fail:
- Run `node test/api-tests.js` locally first
- Check that server is running on expected port
- Verify all JSON database files are present
