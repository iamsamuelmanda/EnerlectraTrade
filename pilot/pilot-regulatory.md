## Kabwe Pilot Regulatory Narrative (ERB-Safe)

### 1. Regulatory Positioning

Enerlectra is an **energy technology and coordination platform**, not an electricity generator, distributor, or seller. The platform records contributions, computes ownership, simulates energy outcomes, and distributes results mathematically.

### 2. What Enerlectra Does

* Records voluntary capital contributions
* Computes proportional ownership
* Simulates energy generation and consumption scenarios
* Distributes outcomes based on ownership

### 3. What Enerlectra Does NOT Do

* Does not generate electricity
* Does not sell electricity
* Does not transmit or distribute electricity
* Does not set tariffs

### 4. Pilot Classification

The Kabwe Pilot qualifies as:

* A **non-commercial demonstration**
* A **data-gathering exercise**
* A **community education and validation project**

### 5. Licensing Position

Because Enerlectra does not engage in electricity generation, transmission, or sale, the pilot does **not trigger IPP or utility licensing requirements**. Any physical installation is conducted by licensed third-party suppliers.

### 6. Consumer Protection

* No guaranteed returns are promised
* Contributions are acknowledged but not marketed as investments
* Ownership reflects proportional participation only

### 7. ERB Engagement Objective

The objective of ERB engagement is transparency, sandbox participation, and early alignment — not exemption. Enerlectra seeks guidance to ensure long-term compliance as the platform evolves.
