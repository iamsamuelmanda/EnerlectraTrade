* Percentage of participants who can correctly explain ownership logic
* Ownership recalculation accuracy (100% deterministic)

### 3. Energy Metrics (Simulated / Measured)

* Deficit vs surplus ratio
* Cluster status distribution (healthy / stressed / offline)

### 4. Trust & Governance Metrics

* Number of ownership disputes (target: 0 unresolved)
* Number of simulation re-runs requested
* Participant satisfaction score (qualitative)

### 5. System Reliability Metrics

* API uptime during pilot
* Simulation execution success rate
* Distribution correctness (ownership-aligned)

### 6. Go / No-Go Criteria

Proceed to scale if:

* ≥ 80% participant retention
* ≥ 90% participant comprehension of ownership and outcomes
* Zero unresolved disputes related to ownership or distribution
