## Kabwe Pilot Brief

### 1. Purpose

The Kabwe Pilot exists to validate **community contribution → computed ownership → measurable energy outcomes** in a real-world setting. This pilot is not designed to maximize profit, but to prove trust, participation, and operational viability under realistic conditions.

### 2. Scope

* **Location:** Kabwe, Zambia
* **Pilot Cluster:** Kabwe Central Solar Cooperative
* **Duration:** 90 days
* **Participants:** 50–150 community members
* **Infrastructure Target:** 150 kW total planned capacity
* **Energy Source:** Rooftop solar (supplier-installed)

### 3. What the Pilot Will Test

* Will community members contribute capital when ownership is computed transparently?
* Does contribution-based ownership produce understandable and accepted outcomes?
* Can energy generation, deficit, and surplus be simulated and distributed fairly?
* Can Enerlectra operate as a coordination and trust layer without acting as a utility?

### 4. What the Pilot Will NOT Do

* No energy sales to the national grid
* No guaranteed financial returns
* No live payments through the platform
* No licensing as an Independent Power Producer (IPP)

### 5. Pilot Flow (High Level)

1. Community onboarding and education
2. Contributions recorded
3. Ownership computed
4. Energy simulated
5. Outcomes distributed
6. Feedback collected

### 6. Pilot Success Definition

The pilot is successful if participants understand, accept, and trust the system logic, and if Enerlectra can demonstrate repeatable ownership and outcome calculations over the pilot period.
